Reviewer Instructions for Evaluating Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD)
Input:
Policy Document – A set of policies governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions of their functions and constraints.
Target Tool – The specific tool (e.g., BookReservation) for which the TPTD has been generated.
Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD) – A standalone list of policies that must be validated before calling the Target Tool.
Your task is to review each policy separately and assess the correctness and completeness of its description, violation examples, compliance examples, and clarification questions.

Evaluation Criteria

1. Coverage Check (Per Policy Section):
Ensure that the policy description correctly reflects the relevant policy from the Policy Document.
Identify any missing key details that should be included in the policy description.
If a policy is irrelevant or does not apply to the Target Tool, point it out.
2. Violation Examples Check (Per Policy Section):
Verify that the Violating Examples provide diverse and concrete cases of policy violations.
Ensure that each type of violation is covered at least once.
Suggest additional examples if needed to improve coverage and diversity.
3. Compliance Examples Check (Per Policy Section):
Confirm that Compliance Examples are correctly provided for each policy.
Ensure that at least one or two clear and valid examples demonstrate correct policy usage.
Suggest missing compliance examples where necessary.
4. Standalone Nature Check (Per Policy Section):
Each policy section should be self-contained and understandable without referring back to the Policy Document.
Identify if any part of the policy requires additional context that is missing.
5. Clarity & Clarification Questions Check (Per Policy Section):
Ensure that the Clarification Questions address any potential ambiguities in the policy description.
The questions should be actionable and useful for resolving uncertainties.
If necessary, suggest additional or improved clarification questions.
If any policies in the TPTD are unclear or ambiguous, check whether appropriate clarification questions are included.
The questions should help resolve uncertainties and should be actionable.

Final Evaluation Score
After reviewing all the above criteria, assign a General Quality Score to the TPTD based on the following scale:

Score	Description
5	Excellent – TPTD is complete, correct, relevant, well-structured, and self-contained. No issues found.
4	Very Good – TPTD is mostly correct but has minor issues (e.g., missing a minor violation example or an extra policy).
3	Acceptable – TPTD has moderate issues (e.g., missing a key policy or some examples are unclear).
2	Needs Improvement – TPTD is incomplete, has multiple missing policies, or requires referencing the original Policy Document too often.
1	Poor – TPTD is significantly flawed, missing major validation steps, or includes incorrect policies.
Provide an explanation for the assigned score, listing key reasons and suggested improvements if necessary.
