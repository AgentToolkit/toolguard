LLM Reviewer Instructions for Evaluating Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD)

Input:
You will receive:

Policy Document – A set of policies governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions of their functions and constraints.
Target Tool – The specific tool (e.g., BookReservation) for which the TPTD has been generated.
Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD) – A standalone list of policies that must be validated before calling the Target Tool.
Your task is to review the TPTD against the provided inputs and assess its correctness and completeness.

Evaluation Criteria

Coverage Check:
Ensure that all relevant policies from the Policy Document that apply to the Target Tool are included in the TPTD.
No crucial policies should be missing.
Point out if you recognize a missing policy.

Relevance Check:
Ensure that the TPTD only contains policies relevant to the Target Tool.
There should be no extra or unrelated policies included.
Point out if you recognize an unrelated policy.

Violation Examples Check:
Verify that the TPTD provides multiple concrete and diverse examples of violations for each policy.
Ensure that each type of violation is covered at least once.
Indicate and suggest other examples to make the list of examples more diverse and increase its coverage.

Compliance Examples Check:
Verify that at least one or two correct (compliant) examples are provided for each policy.

Standalone Nature Check:
The TPTD should be fully self-contained and should not require referring back to the original Policy Document for interpretation.
If any external dependencies exist (e.g., needing additional context from the Policy Document), note them.
Clarity & Clarification Questions:

If any policies in the TPTD are unclear or ambiguous, check whether appropriate clarification questions are included.
The questions should help resolve uncertainties and should be actionable.
Final Evaluation Score

After reviewing all the above criteria, assign a General Quality Score to the TPTD based on the following scale:

Score	Description
5	Excellent – TPTD is complete, correct, relevant, well-structured, and self-contained. No issues found.
4	Very Good – TPTD is mostly correct but has minor issues (e.g., missing a minor violation example or an extra policy).
3	Acceptable – TPTD has moderate issues (e.g., missing a key policy or some examples are unclear).
2	Needs Improvement – TPTD is incomplete, has multiple missing policies, or requires referencing the original Policy Document too often.
1	Poor – TPTD is significantly flawed, missing major validation steps, or includes incorrect policies.
Provide an explanation for the assigned score, listing key reasons and suggested improvements if necessary.

Json Output Format:

Your response should include:
{"review":"Coverage Review – Any missing policies? Any unnecessary ones?
Violation Examples Review – Do they cover all types of violations?
Compliance Examples Review – Are correct examples provided?
Standalone Review – Is the TPTD fully self-contained?
Clarity & Clarification Review – Are any policies unclear? Are good clarification questions provided?",
"Final Score":  A numerical rating (1-5) with an explanation.}
