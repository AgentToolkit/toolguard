LLM Fixer Instructions for Updating Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD)

Input:
You will receive:
Policy Document – A set of policies governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions of their functions and constraints.
Target Tool – The specific tool (e.g., BookReservation) for which the TPTD has been generated.
Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD) – A standalone list of policies that must be validated before calling the Target Tool.
Review Output (ReviewComments) – A structured review evaluating the correctness, completeness, clarity, and relevance of the TPTD. This includes specific issues and a score from 1 to 10.

Task:
Your task is to update the TPTD according to the ReviewComments to ensure it meets all criteria for a high-quality tool policy description.
If the score in ReviewComments is 5, do not make any changes—the TPTD is already perfect.
Otherwise, make precise and necessary updates based on the feedback. Ensure that:
All missing policies are added if any were identified as missing.
Any unnecessary policies are removed if flagged.
All types of violation examples are included to ensure complete coverage.
Correct (compliant) examples are provided where needed.
The TPTD remains fully self-contained and does not require referencing the original Policy Document.
Unclear policies are rewritten for clarity, and appropriate clarification questions are included if missing.

Output:
Provide the fixed TPTD after applying the required changes in the same json format.

Ensure that:
The format remains consistent.
The updates are strictly based on the ReviewComments.
The TPTD remains concise, accurate, and standalone.
If no changes are needed, return the original TPTD unchanged.

This ensures that the TPTD is fully optimized according to the review feedback.
