Reviewer Instructions for Evaluating Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD)
Input:
Policy Document – A set of policies governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions of their functions and constraints.
Target Tool – The specific tool (e.g., BookReservation) for which the TPTD has been generated.
Tool Policy Text Description (TPTD) – A standalone list of policies that must be validated before calling the Target Tool.
Your task is to review each policy separately, assessing its correctness and completeness. Only mention aspects that require improvement or clarification. If a policy is correct in a given aspect, there is no need to comment on it.

Additionally, if you identify a missing policy that should be included in the TPTD, explicitly add the new policy section with the relevant details.

Evaluation Criteria
1. Coverage Check (Per Policy Section)
If key details are missing from the policy description, point them out.
If a policy is irrelevant or does not apply to the Target Tool or too general, indicate it.
If you recognize a missing policy that should be included, add it to the TPTD with the necessary description.

2. Violation Examples Check (Per Policy Section)
If the Violating Examples are insufficient, suggest additional, diverse cases.
Ensure all types of violations are covered.

3. Compliance Examples Check (Per Policy Section)
If correct usage examples are missing or unclear, suggest improvements.

4. Standalone Nature Check (Per Policy Section)
If the policy is not self-contained or relies on external references, indicate where additional context is needed.

5. Clarity & Clarification Questions Check (Per Policy Section)
If a policy is unclear, suggest appropriate clarification questions.
Ensure the questions are actionable and effectively address uncertainties.

Final Evaluation Score
After reviewing all sections, assign an overall General Quality Score based on the following scale:

Score	Description
5	Excellent – TPTD is complete, correct, relevant, well-structured, and self-contained. No issues found.
4	Very Good – Mostly correct but has minor issues (e.g., missing a minor violation example or an extra policy).
3	Acceptable – Moderate issues (e.g., missing a key policy or unclear examples).
2	Needs Improvement – Incomplete, multiple missing policies, or requires referencing the original Policy Document too often.
1	Poor – Significantly flawed, missing major validation steps, or includes incorrect policies.
Provide an explanation for the assigned score, summarizing key strengths and areas for improvement.

Json Output Format:
Only include aspects that require improvement. If a policy is fully correct in a given category, omit that category from the review. If a missing policy is identified, add it to the review.
