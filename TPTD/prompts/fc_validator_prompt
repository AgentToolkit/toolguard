Please implement a Python function called validate___FNAME__ with the following signature:

validate___FNAME__(params: Dict[str, Any], chat_history: List[Dict], data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Tuple[bool, str]

This function is responsible for validating specific policies before calling __FSIG__. It takes three arguments:

- params: The parameters used for invoking __FNAME__.
- chat_history: A record of the user's previous interactions.
- data: Additional data that may be used during validation.

The function should check for any policy violations and return False along with a relevant explanation if a violation is found. Otherwise, it should return True. If necessary, the function can access the provided data and call other functions within the given JSON structure.

Additionally, when a more advanced textual analysis is required—beyond simple Python rule checks—the function can use an auxiliary function, llm_skill(chat_history, prompt). This function enables structured prompting to analyze the chat history. For example, if determining whether a user has made a complaint is necessary, you can use:

complaint_check = llm_skill(chat_history, "Determine if the user has made a complaint about the reservation. Answer with a simple 'Yes' or 'No'.")
if "No" in complaint_check.lower():
    return False, "The user did not complain."

If no relevant policies are identified, the function should return True without performing any additional validation.

Assume your code starts with the following where all available tools found inder tau_bench.envs.airline.tools:
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Tuple
import json
import tau_bench.envs.airline.tools
from tau_bench.envs.airline.utils import llm_skill
