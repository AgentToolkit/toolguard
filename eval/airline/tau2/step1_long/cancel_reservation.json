It's not directly actionable using only ToolX parameters since we need either tool or user information to confirm these cancellation conditions.\nThe policy is not self-contained as it lacks clarity on what constitutes an 'airline cancellation' within the initial description. Therefore, the alternative description has been provided for added context and completeness.\nOverall, the broad application and missing detailed context reduce its ease of enforcement using ToolX alone.\nThe policy is not relevant to the target tool which is specified for updating reservations and not handling cancellations. The policy is applicable to reservation cancellations rather than modifications which the target tool supports. Though the cancellation conditions are clear, verification can be done by checking timestamps and flight statuses, which is not directly related to the target tool\u2019s functionality. The policy lacks the specific actionability within the context since it pertains to cancellation logic rather than using ToolX which deals with reservation updates. Additionally, the policy lacks clarity on enforcement specific to ToolX and lacks contextual completeness regarding validation steps prior to tool invocation.\nThis policy is relevant to ToolX as it provides guidance on when cancellations can be processed. Although the policy is not specifically tailored to this tool alone, it can be validated using the available data before invoking ToolX. The policy description is clear and complete, providing sufficient detail for implementation using ToolX\u2019s functionalities without needing additional context or references.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it outlines conditions under which a reservation can be cancelled, which aligns with the tool's function of updating reservations. It is not tool-specific because it applies to all reservation cancellations rather than specifics of ToolX usage.

The policy is actionable since ToolX's parameters can accommodate cancellation actions based on validated conditions. It is self-contained as the description clearly states the conditions for cancellation without needing further context from the policy document.\nThe policy is not directly relevant to the tool described as ToolX, which seems to be a tool for updating reservations. The policy could be validated by checking conditions such as booking time or flight cancellation status using tools like 'get_reservation_details'. The description can be enforced using available data, but it does not specifically involve ToolX's parameters or functionalities. This makes the policy not tool-specific, as it can be applied generally across different aspects of reservation management, not specifically the ability to update reservations.

It is not specific to ToolX which deals with updating reservations rather than canceling them. It is unrelated to ToolX's functionality and cannot be validated before calling ToolX. The policy does not provide adequate detail to be self-contained and requires further context, particularly about what conditions need to be met for cancellation. A refined version should specify the conditions under which travel insurance allows cancellation.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX, which handles reservations but is not specifically tailored to any single tool. The cancellation criteria involving travel insurance can be validated if one is aware of the insurance terms before invoking the tool. It is actionable using ToolX parameters such as 'reservation_id' and insurance terms available (health and weather-related reasons). However, the initial description does not fully explain the conditions under which cancellations are authorized, as it doesn't clearly state that these conditions must be specified by the insurance. The alternative description provides clarity and is more self-contained.\nThe policy is not relevant to ToolX since it pertains to the cancellation procedure, which falls under the 'cancel_reservation' tool category. It can not be validated using ToolX because it requires checking for travel insurance and specific conditions, which are unrelated to updating reservations. The policy relies on data from the user's travel insurance, which cannot be actioned or enforced using ToolX's parameters alone. Additionally, the description needed additional context to clarify its applicability to travel insurance purchases for specific reasons.\nThis policy is not specifically tailored to ToolX as it refers to conditions on cancelling flights under certain circumstances, but the tool's description does not mention handling insurance verification or handling cancellation reasons related to health or weather. Additionally, the policy mentions 'passenger', which suggests user specifics, but does not clarify how an agent should confirm the insurance purchase details or conditions. The policy\u2019s validation can be done before invoking the tool; however, it's not actionable using ToolX alone as it does not handle the confirmation of health or weather-related cancellation reasons and requires additional verification steps possibly outside ToolX's capability. The policy is not self-contained, as it assumes familiarity with the policy document context. Suggested alternative describes how the policy should be approached before any changes via the target tool.\nThe policy is not relevant or specific to ToolX, which is focused on updating reservations rather than cancellation.

Given the complexity of cancellations, it is not directly actionable through any specific tool, although conditions for cancellation can be verified before ToolX is used. The policy is not relevant to ToolX, which is presumably the tool described as 'Args: reservation_id...', because ToolX seems to handle reservation updates rather than cancellations. To improve the policy, it should elaborate on contextual conditions and requirements related to cancellations, such as obtaining user confirmation and managing changes within airline policies. Self-containment requires it to include details on the process and constraints related to cancellation within the description itself.\nThe policy is highly relevant and specific to ToolX, which is involved in handling reservation updates including cancellations. However, it lacks clarity regarding the specifics of adherence to refund and compensation policies, making it difficult to validate before invoking ToolX. Additionally, the use of general phrases like 'adhere to airline policies' adds ambiguity, displaying the need for more explicit terms. Suggestions include incorporating defined airline procedures and refund rules, ensuring a self-contained policy. Overall, due to ambiguities and lack of actionable direction specifically towards ToolX, the policy receives a score of 3.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it handles reservations and the cancelation rules apply to the reservations. However, this policy's description is not fully self-contained as it references procedures without explicitly detailing them. The reference to 'all airline-specific procedures related to bookings and payments' makes assumptions about the user's knowledge, which could limit clarity. While the stipulation on requiring user confirmation shows it can be validated before invoking ToolX, the policy does seem openly phrased towards cancellation, not specifically on how it aligns with ToolX functions. Scoring-wise, the policy deserves a 4 due to relevance and the ability to enforce action based on its outline. Making it more specific to ToolX functionalities could raise the score.\nThe policy addresses the cancellation of business-class flights, which can happen anytime without specific conditions. However, it does not mention ToolX ('Args: reservation_id' relates to cancel_reservation tool), suggesting a broader tool application. Additional references should include the refund policies detailed in the 'Refund' section logics. The relevant check for adhering to refund policies indicates the policy can be validated before use. It is actionable as the reservation_id can be acquired using the 'get_user_details' tool, but the policy needs clarity on specific constraints like refund conditions linked with membership tiers and insurance claims. The alternative description simplifies and focuses the policy scope and makes it self-contained, streamlining actionable elements. Score: 3 \u2013 owing to its lack of direct relevance and clarity regarding specific actionable constraints.\nThis policy is relevant to the cancellation of business class flights and aligns with the policy document's stipulation that restrictions for cancellation do not apply to business class flights. While the policy is actionable and can be validated with user confirmation, it does not specifically mention the tool to be invoked ('cancel_reservation'). It should incorporate details specific to using the targeted tool and considerations related to refund and compensation policies. I propose expanding the current description with more specifics about human transfer conditions and refund timelines, aiming at improved completeness of the policy description.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Cancel Only Unflown Trips", "description": "To cancel a reservation, the agent must first verify that none of the flight segments within the reservation have been flown.

However, it is not directly applicable to the specific functionalities of ToolX as described. ToolX updates reservations, and the cancellation processes or conditions are not handled by or designed for ToolX as described. Moreover, it is not actionable solely with the parameters of ToolX since validation of whether a flight segment has been flown is outside ToolX's specified functionality. The policy seems relevant more to a tool specifically designed for canceling reservations rather than updating them.\nThis policy is relevant to ToolX ('cancel_reservation') as it pertains to the conditions under which a reservation can be canceled using the tool. However, it is not tool-specific because the relevance applies to general booking actions and requires an external verification of the flight segment status, which cannot be determined solely by the tool's parameters. Compliance cannot be validated before invoking ToolX since the policy involves checking the flight segment status, a step that requires potentially accessing another tool or data source. The policy is not actionable strictly using ToolX parameters, chat history, or data access, as it needs status confirmation of flights, which may involve querying flight statuses. Additionally, the policy is self-contained and clear without requiring external references. For these reasons, I would score this policy a 3 as it lacks verification and actionability solely through ToolX.\nThe policy is relevant to the Target Tool as it concerns cancellation actions. It is not tool specific because it applies to general procedures that involve multiple tools, not just the Target Tool. Compliance can be validated by checking the flight status through the 'get_flight_status' or 'get_flight_instance' before using the cancellation tool. This policy is actionable, but its description lacks clarity about how to check for flown segments; suggesting using 'get_flight_status' or 'get_flight_instance'. The policy is not entirely self-contained as it requires prior knowledge about how flights are checked for flown status, which should be explicitly mentioned in the policy. The alternative description clarifies these aspects.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX since it involves decisions about reservations, which ToolX appears to manage. However, it's not specific to ToolX, as it doesn't mention specific functionality or constraints of the tool, which makes it applicable more broadly across different scenarios or platforms. The policy can be validated before using ToolX by checking if all segments are unflown, a task that requires details from other tools to confirm the status of flight segments. It's not fully actionable since it lacks clear instructions or constraints specific to ToolX's functionality, requiring additional steps before using ToolX (like accessing flight status details through other tools). The policy description is not completely self-contained because it doesn't specify how to verify the status of flight segments or the mechanism for transferring requests, which might require context from the broader policy document or other tools.

While actionable through user chat confirmations, the tool itself cannot enforce this alone, hence not fully actionable. The policy description is self-contained, and the description is clear regarding the action required when segments are already used.\nThe policy is relevant because it directly applies to how cancellations are handled, and inaccuracies in handling cancellations can lead to user dissatisfaction. It can be validated by checking the status of each segment in the reservation before initiating a cancellation attempt, ensuring no segment has been used.

A refined description provides a clearer rationale and allows for seamless implementation without needing a reference to the broader policy document.\nThe policy is relevant as it deals with the cancellation process and specifies the need for human intervention if segments are used, which is applicable to the target tool. It is not tool-specific because it does not involve a particular tool but rather a procedure. The policy can be validated before invoking the tool by checking if segments of a reservation are used. It is not actionable via ToolX solely since transferring to a human agent isn't a parameter-driven process and requires verification via chat history. The policy needs to be self-contained by redefining the procedure explicitly regarding cancellation and transferring users when segments are partially flown.\nThe policy is clear about transferring users to a human agent if any flight segments are already used. However, it is not relevant to the target tool, as it doesn't describe a procedure that can be applied or validated via the tool's functionalities. The policy does not specify mechanisms or contexts that could be validated preemptively, and its enforcement requires actions beyond the tool's specification. Thus, it is not actionable with ToolX.

The policy cannot be validated using the tool parameters nor enforced through ToolX's capabilities, as it is prescriptive rather than procedural. The original description is concise and self-contained.\nThe policy on refund processing time does not specifically pertain to the target ToolX, as it deals with the time it takes for refunds to be processed to the original payment methods. There's no mechanism provided to validate or enforce this policy using ToolX, nor can compliance be assured before ToolX is invoked since processing time is an external factor outside ToolX's control. Additionally, refunds are typically processed by the financial systems of the airline, not by software tools used by agents such as ToolX. For these reasons, the policy cannot be effectively enforced or validated using this tool.\nThe policy 'Refund Processing Time' refers to the timeline for how refunds are processed but does not specify any action related to ToolX or its usage constraints. Since ToolX is particularly about updating reservations, this policy's relevance is low in that context. It's too general and not specific to ToolX or any tool constraints provided. As it stands, the policy cannot be validated or enforced via ToolX parameters, chat history, or data access. A score of 2 indicates a clear and self-contained description, yet low relevance and applicability to ToolX.\nThe policy 'Refund Processing Time' is not relevant to ToolX since ToolX concerns the reservation process rather than refund processing. This policy is broadly applicable to refund processes and does not require tool-specific actions or validations before ToolX is invoked. It describes an outcome (the time frame of a refund) rather than providing actionable steps that can be performed by ToolX. For ToolX, actionable policies would relate directly to modifying reservation details or similar functions. Thus, no improvement to the policy description is necessary as it is already self-contained but irrelevant in this context.\nThe policy 'Refund Processing Time' is not specifically relevant to ToolX, which deals with reservation updates and returns the updated reservation. ToolX cannot validate or enforce refund timelines, as these are typically part of backend processing logic not controlled by the tool's functionality. Since the policy dictates information diffused to the user on the refund process, rather than an actionable procedure involving ToolX, it cannot be deemed actionable directly by ToolX's usage parameters.\n"}]}
