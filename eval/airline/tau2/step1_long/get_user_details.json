It is relevant as it directly pertains to the target ToolX, which deals with retrieving user details. However, it lacks tool-specific instructions, which limits its actionable use since no specific actions related to ToolX or its functionalities (e.g., fetching user details via ToolX) are outlined. Furthermore, while it can be validated by checking if these elements exist in the profile before ToolX invocation, the policy does not include steps for any enforcement. Therefore, despite being self-contained, it does not suggest actions to take based on this information. A higher score would be given if actionable steps were included.\nThis policy provides a general description of user profile attributes and does not contain any specific instructions or constraints applicable to ToolX. Thus, it is neither relevant nor actionable for the tool targeted. Furthermore, it cannot be validated before using ToolX as it does not define criteria for verification or explicit user action. The policy is self-contained as it clearly outlines what a user profile contains without needing further context.\nThe policy describes the contents of a user profile. However, it does not directly reference ToolX or indicate any specific usage related to ToolX functionalities. ToolX involves retrieving user details, but this policy does not explain how profiles relate to ToolX actions or decision-making, nor does it provide actionable rules particular to ToolX. Although clearly stated, the policy lacks directed application for the tool in use, therefore it's not relevant to ToolX.\nThe policy describes general information about user profiles utilized in the airline agent domain. This information is not specific to ToolX as described in the target tool, which focuses on retrieving user details using the 'user_id'. The policy itself does not involve actionable instructions or validation processes; it merely enumerates the data fields related to a user profile. No actionable steps can be enforced directly by ToolX or any constraints imposed by the policy itself. Therefore, it lacks relevance and actionability in the specific context of invoking ToolX.\nThe policy is relevant as it deals with user profile information, which is essential for various operations in ToolX, such as fetching user details. However, the policy is not specific to ToolX as it describes general user profile information applicable across multiple domains or tools. The policy can be validated, as ToolX can check whether a user's profile contains the listed information before initiating operations. Since the policy description implies data structure rather than an actionable procedure, it cannot be enforced using ToolX's parameters, chat history, or data access directly. A score of 3 is assigned because while the policy is clear and provides essential information, its applicability is broad and does not provide specific actionable steps for ToolX.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Action Update Confirmation", "description": "Before using the 'get_user_details' tool, the agent must obtain explicit user confirmation ('yes') regarding any changes they wish to make, including booking, flight modifications, baggage editing, cabin class upgrades, or passenger information adjustments.", "references": ["Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed."], "iteration": 4, "comments": "The policy does not directly apply to the target tool, which is specifically for user details and not for booking database updates. Additionally, the policy is too broad and applies to actions across multiple tools involved with reservation updates rather than being specific. The policy can be validated before using any tool that updates the booking database, as obtaining explicit user confirmation is straightforward. However, ToolX cannot independently enforce obtaining explicit confirmation without additional systems or information. The initial policy lacked specificity about what updates are included, and its application seems to span multiple tools. The improved description clarifies the specific actions and the requirement for user confirmation, making it more self-contained.\nThe policy is not relevant to the target tool as it relates to confirmation of changes before database updates, while ToolX provides details of user profiles. The policy does not specifically apply to any tools listed or the target tool. Moreover, this policy cannot be validated before using the target tool and is not enforceable using its parameters alone. The policy is clear and complete but does not specifically reference ToolX or its functionalities.\nThe policy is relevant as it directs agents to confirm actions before updating the database with any changes made to reservations, which aligns with the functionalities provided by ToolX related to obtaining user details. While not specific to ToolX alone, the policy can be validated prior to tool invocation by requiring explicit user confirmation, making it actionable through logging and verification processes tied to ToolX. The policy is clear, concise, and does not require additional contextual information from the policy document, yielding a high score for applicability and completeness.\nThe current policy is not specifically applicable to the target tool 'get_user_details'. The policy addresses general procedures for confirming user actions before database updates across various actions, but does not directly align with the functionality of 'get_user_details', which only retrieves user details. As such, the score reflects its lack of specificity to ToolX. Additionally, the policy mentions intentions for database modifications without specifying the context of ToolX, making it not self-contained. The alternative description adjusts the context to relate more directly to confirming user intent before using ToolX for relevant tool calls.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Single Tool Call Interaction", "description": "You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, do not make a tool call simultaneously.", "references": ["You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously.", "If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time."], "iteration": 4, "comments": "The policy is relevant to ToolX since ToolX involves interaction with tool calls and user communication. Although applicable to any tool, the policy clearly defines sequential operations in tool and user interaction. It is actionable since it requires understanding operational sequence during tool use and user responses. Validation is possible by ensuring no simultaneous calls or responses during use sessions. The existing description is complete; no missing information. However, this policy is too general and can apply to any tool interaction, not just ToolX.\nThe policy primarily aims to manage tool usage and interactions. However, it is not relevant to 'ToolX', a tool specifically for user details retrieval. This policy is rather broad, applying to the interaction protocol for all tools, not tailored specifically for ToolX. It is clear, actionable, and can be validated preemptively within any agent's session prior to making tool calls to ensure compliance with interaction protocols.\nThe policy is clear and actionable in terms of interaction management, ensuring that tool calls and user responses do not occur simultaneously. However, it is generally applicable to any tool usage scenario rather than being specific to ToolX. It could help improve process efficiency by focusing interactions, but it does not particularly pertain to ToolX itself. The policy can be validated through system design, ensuring that tool usage and user interaction are separate. It is self-contained as it clearly states the constraints without needing additional context.\nThe policy 'Single Tool Call Interaction' does address tool interactions, but the specific constraints mentioned in the policy are broad and not tailored to any particular tool, including ToolX. This policy does not particularly relate to ToolX, which is about retrieving user details. The policy suggests overall guidelines on tool interaction and does not integrate with the functional and operational aspects of ToolX as described. Furthermore, it cannot be validated because it is not a compliance rule applying to the correctness or successful completion of information retrieval in ToolX. The policy could apply operationally but is more suitable as a general standard across all tools rather than actionable specifically for ToolX. Given these points, the description of the policy is self-contained regarding the interaction standard, without needing additional context from the policy document.\nThe policy is relevant since it imposes constraints on how the tool call of ToolX should be made, ensuring proper interaction handling. However, it is not tool-specific; it applies broadly to any tool interaction within the policy framework. The policy can be validated before using ToolX by checking if any other tool invocation or user response is pending or being processed. The policy is actionable as it can be enforced using ToolX's parameters, chat history, and data access. As the description is complete and clear without requiring extra context, it is considered self-contained.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Transfer to Human Agent", "description": "Transfer the user to a human agent only if: (1) The user explicitly requests to speak with a human agent. (2) You are unable to resolve the user's issue using the policy stipulations and available tools.", "references": ["You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions."], "iteration": 2, "comments": "The policy is relevant for the tool's context but is not specific to the target tool, as it applies to all tools the agent uses. It can be validated before invoking the tool by checking if the request is beyond the agent's capabilities or requires tools not available. It's actionable as it pertains to decision-making rather than tool execution. The initial description is vague, as it does not fully describe the criteria for transferring to a human agent\u2014hence, the addition of explicit criteria for clarity.\nThe policy is relevant to the target tool since the tool returns user details and could be part of determining whether a transfer to human is needed. While it is not specific to the target tool 'get_user_details', the policy applies to situations that cannot be addressed with any available tool, including ToolX. The policy is actionable and can be validated because ToolX\u2019s data can help ascertain whether a request can be handled with available tools. As currently written, the policy is self-contained, providing clear guidance on when an agent should transfer a user to a human.\nThe policy is not directly relevant to the 'get_user_details' tool, as it does not involve any user detail fetching or managing. The policy is too general and could apply to any tool-related context, and therefore isn't tool-specific. The policy can be validated in terms of determining if a request falls outside the scope of the agent's capabilities, but it depends on user interaction rather than tool specifications. As the policy advises action based on user requests or scope limitations, it does not utilize ToolX parameters. The original description is somewhat ambiguous and oversimplified. It lacks clarity regarding the specific actions that should lead to transferring to a human agent. The proposed alternative version clarifies the conditions under which transfers should occur. Overall, it lacks explicit actionability and does not integrate with ToolX operations; hence scored a 3 for being clear in context but lacking in specificity and applicability.\nThe policy is relevant to the specific tool as it determines when to transfer to a human, which is a feature of 'transfer_to_human_agents'. Although the policy can be validated before using the tool, and the constraints listed can help determine if an action is needed, the policy is not tool-specific as it applies to any situation requiring human intervention, irrespective of ToolX or any other tool. It is actionable since it relies on the user's request or the ability of available tools to solve an issue, which can be determined using user data and tool functionalities. The policy's description needs enhancement to be fully self-contained; adding conditions clearly helps make it explicit and stand-alone. Given these factors, a score of 4 is appropriate for clear direction but requires better integration of tool applicability.\nThe policy 'Transfer to Human Agent' is well-crafted and understandable on its own, despite not being specifically relevant to ToolX, which focuses primarily on retrieving user details. This policy is less about applying specific technical actions and more about a conceptual guideline to determine when a human agent should be involved. Since ToolX relates to getting user details, this policy involves broader decision-making rather than that specific functionality. However, the policy is actionable within the informational boundary of a broader tool framework as part of a decision process but not necessarily specific or validated directly by a processing step within ToolX.\n"}]}
