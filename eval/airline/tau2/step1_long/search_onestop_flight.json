The operation of tool usage should be isolated to ensure clear, undisturbed processing.", "references": ["You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time."], "iteration": 3, "comments": "The policy is part of general interaction guidelines rather than specific instructions relevant to ToolX (which appears to be related to searching flights). Since ToolX involves searching flight options, the policy of single tool interaction does not directly apply, as the completion of a search is self-contained and does not require sequential tool calls or simultaneous responses. Additionally, the described policy cannot be validated in advance, nor can it be enforced strictly via ToolX's parameters, chat history, or data access given its focus on interactive methods. I suggest reviewing tool-specific interaction needs for ToolX if separate policies apply.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX, the 'search_onestop_flight' tool, as it dictates the manner in which this and other tools should be invoked. However, it isn't specific to ToolX, and it doesn't specify how compliance can be validated before tool invocation. The policy is actionable for any chat interaction involving ToolX, but clarity is lacking in the context of validating individual interactions before use. To enrich the clarity and make the policy actionable, an additional parameter or system check should be integrated to ensure proper sequential interaction. Therefore, it earns a score of 3, sufficient but needing Defined steps or techniques for validation.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX, as it directly relates to how ToolX should be used in conjunction with user interactions. However, this policy is not specific to just ToolX, as it applies to all tools used by the agent, emphasizing the sequential nature of tool calls and user interactions. Compliance can be validated by checking if tool calls and user interactions happen sequentially. The description is clear and doesn't require further context for understanding, thus it's self-contained. The policy is actionable because avoiding concurrent tool calls and user interactions can be managed using the chat history and parameters related to tool usage. \nThe policy is relevant and actionable specifically for the 'search_onestop_flight' tool, implying that no concurrent user interaction should occur during its execution. However, it applies to all tools, thus not being entirely tool-specific. Validation can be done by ensuring that tool operation logs indicate no overlapping user interaction or that an interface lock occurs during tool execution. The policy's description is not entirely self-contained, failing to mention reasons for such isolation, which could relate to preventing data inconsistency or errors due to competing processes. The suggested alternative description improves clarity and provides a rationale for isolation.

The request cannot be resolved using the available tools or within your defined capabilities.", "references": ["You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions."], "iteration": 3, "comments": "The policy is not specifically relevant to the Target Tool (ToolX: 'search_onestop_flight') as it does not directly pertain to its functionality of searching one-stop flights. It is more of a general protocol applicable to all tool usages rather than one tailored for ToolX specifically. This aspect also makes the policy not tool-specific. However, the policy can be validated before invoking any tool, as the agent can assess whether a tool usage can resolve the user\u2019s request. The policy is actionable, as it requires the agent to transfer to a human agent when unable to handle a request based on the available tools and policy constraints. It's not self-contained since it might need clarification regarding the scope and the tools available. A refined alternative description is provided for better clarity.\nThe policy is relevant to the target tool, as it outlines conditions for transferring a user to a human agent, which includes scenarios where the tool's capabilities are insufficient. The policy is not specific to 'search_onestop_flight', as it applies generally to all tools and agent interactions. Compliance can be validated by checking whether the tool supports required actions or whether the agent can handle the request as defined, making it actionable. The description is clear and provides sufficient information without needing additional context, making it self-contained.\nThis policy is relevant for ToolX in cases where the tool's functions cannot solve the user's issue, especially when direct flight data cannot address the user's needs. It is not specific to ToolX but applies to any scenario where the limitations of the available tools require escalation to human agents. The policy is actionable, as the requirement for transfer can be determined based on users' requests and the capabilities of the tool. However, it cannot be validated beforehand because it requires interaction and determination during usage. Since the policy is directly extractable from the document with no external dependencies for its interpretation, it is self-contained. The score reflects its applicability and user clarity.\nThe policy is not specifically relevant to Target Tool X, as it identifies a general practice for transferring users based on the capabilities of the tools and agent online systems. The policy is generic and not tool-specific, applying to many tools. While it can be validated since it is possible to check whether the issue can be addressed using the tools at hand, it is not actionable solely within the confines of ToolX's parameters, chat history, or data access as it involves decisions on user requests in a broader sense, not necessarily confined to those obtained from the target tool. Given the situation, there's no need to describe individual tool constraints or parameters. The policy description is clear and self-explanatory, encompassing the scenario for user transfer adequately. Suggest widening the scope to identify cases where the tool or agent cannot address an issue promptly.\nThe policy 'User Transfer Protocol' is too broad and not specific to the target tool described. The target tool specifically relates to flight data and booking functionalities, whereas this policy pertains to transferring users to a human agent. There is no direct link to the target tool's functionalities. The policy can be validated because the criteria for transferring a user (unable to handle request) can be assessed before making the decision. The policy relies on agent discretion beyond tool-specific parameters and is therefore not actionable just using ToolX. The provided alternative description clarifies conditions for transferring a user to a human agent and is self-contained. Overall, given the lack of specificity and inability to act solely through ToolX, this policy is not well-tailored for it.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Denied Actions", "description": "The agent must deny requests involving actions beyond ToolX's capabilities or due to existing policy constraints. For ToolX, these include adjusting or modifying flights and alterations to checked baggage allowances when they exceed ToolX's functional limits.", "references": ["You should deny user requests that are against this policy."], "iteration": 3, "comments": "The policy is too general and doesn't relate specifically to ToolX, nor does it provide actionable guidance on how to determine if a request is against the policy. It needs to be tailored to specific constraints of ToolX usage to be more relevant and actionable. Additionally, it cannot be validated directly before usage, as it requires a clear set of criteria to evaluate the request against, which the policy does not provide.\nThe policy is relevant, as it involves denying actions that are against the policy. However, the policy lacks specificity regarding ToolX and is not self-contained because it doesn't mention the specific constraints relevant to ToolX. The enforcement of the policy is not actionable using only ToolX\u2019s parameters as it is a broad directive rather than a specific guideline. The description should be refined to explicitly include criteria for determining violations specific to ToolX usage, ensuring clarity and completeness. Suggestions include highlighting constraints relevant to ToolX explicitly and providing a clear process for how violations should be assessed and handled.\nThe policy provided is not specifically relevant to ToolX, which handles searching for one-stop flights and hence does not directly involve actions concerning flight modifications and cancellations. The description is quite broad and does not focus on particular constraints or functionalities associated with ToolX. Additionally, the policy cannot be validated before ToolX is used, and it lacks actionable elements tied to ToolX's parameters or specific scenarios handled by ToolX. The policy is also not self-contained, as it references general constraints without detailing what those might be for ToolX. A more refined description has been proposed to provide clearer guidelines and a context that could be checked before any ToolX operations, making the policy more usable within the tool's framework.\nThe policy appears to be too broad in scope which makes it difficult to apply it specifically to ToolX. It refers to general constraints within the airline agent's policies without explicitly addressing the specific constraints or functionalities of ToolX, the target tool described. For instance, ToolX outputs lists of direct flight pairings, which doesn't directly involve modifying reservations or canceling flights as mentioned. It cannot be validated or enforced using ToolX's parameters alone. An alternative description narrows the policy to ToolX's capabilities, focusing on denying actions not supported by the tool. The policy could benefit from specifying exact actions and constraints relevant to ToolX, making it more self-contained and actionable.\nThe current policy lacks specificity regarding ToolX. It references denying actions that cannot be executed, which is relevant, but it's too broad and not uniquely tailored to ToolX. While compliance can be validated before invocation, its actionable nature is limited since it does not specify the particular capabilities of ToolX. The policy description requires additional context because it doesn't provide specific examples aligned with ToolX's known functions. The refined description provides better clarity by detailing exact limitations relevant to ToolX.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Booking Confirmation Protocol", "description": "Before proceeding with updates to the booking database via available tools such as booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, or passenger information, ensure the user confirms the details of the action. This includes presenting the summarized action details to the user and obtaining explicit confirmation (e.g., the user responds with 'yes').", "references": ["Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed."], "iteration": 3, "comments": "The policy is related to booking operations but not directly relevant to the functionality of ToolX (search_onestop_flight), which does not update the booking database. Therefore, it is not tailored to ToolX and is more broadly applicable to all tools that perform booking or modification actions. However, the policy can be validated before using ToolX by confirming that actions requiring user confirmation do not apply. The policy is self-contained and clear, but not directly applicable to the search_onestop_flight tool.\nWhile the policy outlines a general procedure for booking confirmation, it is not relevant to the target tool, which is specifically linked to searching onestop flights. The policy does not specify how the confirmation should be integrated with the target tool. Although this procedure can be validated before invoking ToolX, it is too broad and not actionable for ToolX. The policy should be rewritten to focus on confirmation procedures associated specifically with actions involving ToolX. The policy's completeness can be improved by including specific steps or checks to confirm with the user before processing actions, which may involve direct integration with ToolX parameters.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it pertains to the interaction sequence requiring confirmation before using a tool. The requirements for user confirmation are clear, making the policy actionable. While it is not specific to ToolX, it applies to any tool that updates the booking database. The policy can be validated before invoking ToolX by confirming if the user has given explicit agreement for the action. The policy is self-contained, as its description is complete and does not require additional context.\nThe policy is not specifically relevant to the target tool 'search_onestop_flight', as it focuses on actions that update the booking database, which the current tool does not perform. The policy is not tool-specific since it applies to a variety of available tools rather than a particular one. Compliance with the policy can be validated before invoking tools that update bookings by checking for user confirmation. However, the policy is not actionable solely based on ToolX\u2019s parameters, chat history, and data access, as user interaction is required to obtain confirmation. The description is self-contained and clear in its requirements.\nThe policy is not specifically relevant to the Target Tool ('search_onestop_flight'), as it pertains to actions involving updates to the booking database, which are not part of this tool's functionality. The policy is too broad and not tool-specific, as it applies to several functions rather than being tailored to one tool. The policy's compliance can indeed be validated by checking whether user confirmation is obtained before invoking any database updates, so validation before tool invocation is possible. The policy is actionable because it can be enforced using ToolX\u2019s parameters, chat history, and data access. However, since the tool in question is concerned with searching for flights, this policy does not align with its function. The policy description is self-contained and does not require additional context from the document. The score reflects that while the policy is clear and enforceable, it lacks relevance to the specified tool.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Information Constraint", "description": "You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.", "references": ["You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments."], "iteration": 3, "comments": "This policy, 'Information Constraint,' is relevant to ensuring that the service provided is consistent and factual, based solely on data provided by the user or available tools. It is applicable across all tools, including ToolX, which is used for searching flights, by restricting the agent from adding any additional information or recommendations not sourced from the tool itself. It does not require validation before using ToolX as it defines a general constraint on agent communication regardless of the specific tool in use. The policy is actionable within the current framework as it can be enforced using available user and tool data, ensuring that responses are strictly within the provided parameters. The policy is self-contained, meaning the description provides full understanding without needing additional context from the policy document. A score of 4 is given as it clearly conveys its purpose but lacks explicit steps on validation, reducing its effectiveness in pre-tool usage verification.\nThe policy is not directly relevant to the target ToolX ('search_onestop_flight'). It applies broadly to agent behavior across all tools rather than specific constraints for ToolX. While it can be validated by checking the user's requests against available tool functionalities, enforcing this policy does not involve using specific parameters that ToolX requires, making it non-actionable. The description is clear and does not require additional context.\nThe policy, while clear, does not specifically apply to the tool 'search_onestop_flight'. The tool is used for searching flights based on origin, destination, and date. The policy regarding information constraint is a broad guideline for interaction and does not directly impact the functionality of searching flights. Therefore, it cannot be validated before invoking the tool nor enforced using the tool's parameters. While the policy is self-contained and clear, it is too general to be useful for the specific task of using 'search_onestop_flight'. Consider adding context or examples that show how an information constraint could impact a flight search interaction.\nThe policy is relevant for any tool usage involving user interaction, not specifically tailored to the target tool 'search_onestop_flight'. While preventing provision of information beyond available data can be validated by ensuring interactions are based only on provided or tool-accessible information, the policy offers no actionable enforcement measures related to the parameters or data of 'search_onestop_flight'. To improve relevance and applicability, consider including guidelines specific to how information constraints apply when using 'search_onestop_flight'. This would include scenarios like verifying flight information solely through available data without external or speculative comments.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX because it limits the information that can be utilized during the operation, ensuring adherence to standard protocols. However, it is not tool-specific, as it applies to the overall operation involving any tool used by the agent. This constraint can be validated by checking if the agent only uses provided user data and available tools without subjective input. While the policy is clear, it is not actionable solely with ToolX\u2019s parameters or operations since it governs a broader context, not just the functionality of a specific tool. Thus, it cannot be enforced using only ToolX\u2019s parameters. However, it is self-contained and does not require additional context. Improvements are not necessary in terms of clarity or completeness.\n"}]}
