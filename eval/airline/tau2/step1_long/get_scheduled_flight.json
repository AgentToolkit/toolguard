{"policies": [], "archive": [{"policy_name": "Single Action Requirement Policy", "description": "Ensure exclusivity in tool and user interactions by making only one tool call at a time, without simultaneous user responses during the call, and vice versa.", "references": ["You should only make one tool call at a time.", "If you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously.", "If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time."], "iteration_added": 2, "comments": "The policy is clear and maintains exclusivity of user and tool interactions but is not specifically relevant to ToolX as it does not have direct implications on flight scheduling tasks or require constraints related to user interactions while making tool calls. The rule can be validated by ensuring that no interactions occur simultaneously during a tool call, satisfying enforceability criteria. The policy is sufficiently self-contained as it provides clear instructions without needing additional details from the larger policy document. It might need tailoring to fit specific relevance if applied directly to ToolX.\nThe policy does not specifically apply to ToolX as described. ToolX is about getting flight schedules, and this policy is regarding the exclusivity of tool interactions in general, which applies to all tools mentioned. ToolX does not involve interaction that would necessitate this exclusivity policy specifically. The policy is clear and actionable; it can be validated by ensuring that ToolX is not generating or receiving concurrent outputs while the user is being responded to or another tool call is being made. The references provided are aptly extracted, showing clear linkage to single-action requirement policy.\nThe policy is about general behavioral guidelines for tool interactions and user responses rather than specific actions related to ToolX's functionality (GetScheduledFlight). This makes it non-relevant for ToolX specifically, which deals with retrieving flight schedules based on the flight number. The policy is more of a procedural guideline than an actionable constraint that involves the parameters, chat history, and data access of ToolX. Since the policy does not contain conditions that can be validated before using ToolX, it is not actionable in the context of this tool. The provided references give clear guidance on the intended behavior, making the policy self-contained though not applicable to ToolX.\nThe policy is not specific to ToolX since it does not mention or require actions related to flight schedules or the specific capabilities of ToolX. The policy is a general interaction guideline applicable to any tool. While enforcement of the policy can be assured by monitoring user-tool interaction patterns, it is not enforceable solely through ToolX's capabilities and requires a data management layer to verify compliance. Since exclusivity in tool usage and user communication is logical and precautionary, the policy is sufficiently self-contained and easily understandable. Given these observations, the policy gets a low score as it does not add value to the specific context of ToolX.\nThis policy is relevant for ToolX as it requires them to not engage in user interactions while performing a tool call, or vice versa. The policy is not tool-specific as it applies universally to interactions involving any tool. ToolX can validate this before each call by ensuring it has no active user response pending or ongoing. The policy is actionable using ToolX\u2019s parameters and process management to enforce interaction exclusivity effectively. The description is self-contained, clearly outlining the policy with no need for additional context.\n"}]}
