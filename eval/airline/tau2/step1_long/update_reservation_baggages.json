Improving clarity with the alternative description makes the policy standalone.\nThis policy is not specifically relevant to the target tool (ToolX: update_reservation_baggages) because it does not outline usage for updating reservations but describes the baggage allowance based on membership tier. The policy can be validated before invoking ToolX as the baggage guidelines can be referenced against the passenger's membership level and the baggage details they provided. It is actionable because the target tool parameters can include baggage counts and the relevant payment details in case of extra baggage. The policy is self-contained as it describes all relevant information regarding baggage allowance clearly.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX as it needs to validate baggage allowance during baggage updates according to membership tier. While the policy isn't specific to ToolX, it can still be validated before invoking ToolX by checking the user's membership status and the baggage limit based on the number of free bags allowed by their membership tier. The policy description is clear and actionable as it directly relates to baggage update operations that ToolX may perform.\n"}]}
