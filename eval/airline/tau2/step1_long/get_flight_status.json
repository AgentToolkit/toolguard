The policy ensures sequential operations, which can be validated and are actionable as it mandates behavior rather than tool specifics. However, since it doesn't directly relate to the use of ToolX, it is not relevant or specific to this particular tool. The policy is clear enough and doesn't require additional context from the policy document. Score is derived from its clarity and enforceability but discounted for lack of relevance to ToolX.\nThis policy is not specifically relevant to ToolX because ToolX is related to getting the flight status, which doesn't directly interact with user communication policies. The policy is broad, applying to all tools, not specifically to ToolX. The policy can be validated before using any tool, including ToolX, to ensure no user interaction is happening simultaneously. It is actionable since the actions involved can be controlled by using only tool's parameters and chat history. The description is self-contained and clear without requiring additional context. The policy's description outlines rules for tool and user interaction, ensuring proper protocol is followed. However, the policy does not address any specific constraints or functionalities of ToolX directly.\nThe policy does not appear to be relevant to ToolX as it applies globally to all tools, ensuring that tool calls and user interactions are not conducted at the same time. ToolX is specifically designed to get details about flight status, and the policy does not address requirements or constraints directly related to its usage. The policy is not actionable in terms of enforcing compliance through ToolX\u2019s parameters, chat history, or data access, nor can it be validated prior to use. Given the current description, the policy does not require additional context for comprehension, but it does not pertain specifically to ToolX.\nThe policy is not relevant to ToolX specifically, as it appears to apply generally to any tools within the platform, emphasizing a guideline across all tool usage rather than specific to the flight status tool. The policy is broad and does not mention specific functionalities or constraints pertinent to ToolX. While actionable within operational guidelines, it does not provide criteria or conditions that can be validated with ToolX parameters. The policy is clear enough and does not require extra context from the policy document.\nThe policy is about interaction procedure between tool calls and user responses, which is more of a general procedure applicable to any tool rather than specifically to ToolX. This makes it not relevant for ToolX alone. While it can be validated by ensuring that tool calls and user responses are not executed at the same time, it does not provide specific directions on how ToolX should be used, making it less actionable. It is clear and complete within itself as a procedural guideline.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Prohibition of External Procedures", "description": "You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools.", "references": ["You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments."], "iteration_added": 1, "comments": "The policy of not providing external information is applicable to ToolX since it applies to all operations within the airline agent scope and hence includes the use of 'get_flight_status'. However, it is too broad and applied to all tool usage rather than specifically targeting ToolX. Compliance with this policy cannot be validated before invoking ToolX directly as it relies on what information or procedures are presented during the interaction. It is actionable since the tool can enforce this by adhering strictly to the parameters provided or available in the system. The policy is self-contained as it does not require additional context to understand its application.\nThe policy is generally relevant to operating as an airline agent but not specifically to ToolX, which is designed to retrieve flight statuses. The policy is too broad and could apply to any tool. Compliance can be validated before using ToolX, as the agent does not need to provide external information outside of user input or tool results. The policy allows for actionable use of ToolX without needing additional context from the policy document. It is clear and complete within its scope. Given that the policy is not specific to ToolX, a score of 3 is appropriate.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX, as it outlines that only information and procedures provided by the user or via available tools should be used. However, it is not tool-specific since it applies to all tools, not just ToolX. Compliance cannot be directly validated before using ToolX, as it pertains to agent behavior rather than tool functionality. The policy isn't actionable solely with ToolX's parameters, as it requires general agent compliance outside of tool interactions. No gaps were identified making it unclear or incomplete as it stands independently within the context of the agent's responsibilities.\nThis policy is quite relevant to all interactions involving ToolX when checking the flight status as it specifies constraints on the data sources and information provided, emphasizing the requirement to use established tools or user-provided information. ToolX does offer flight status information, adhering to this policy. However, the policy isn't specific to ToolX and applies generally to multiple tools as it relates to user input and tool availability rather than a specific function. The policy is clear and self-contained as it explicitly outlines the constraints on information sharing and requires no additional context or interpretation.\nThe policy is generally applicable to all tools rather than being specific to any one tool, including ToolX. It restricts the agent from providing external information or procedures beyond those available from users or tools, which is relevant across any tool usage scenario. However, the policy does not specifically take into account the functionalities or constraints of ToolX. Although the policy can be validated, it is not actionable solely based on ToolX's parameters, as it relies on prior inputs or tool outputs received. The policy is well described and clear but does not specifically aim at or restrict ToolX's operations, so it is not relevant or tool-specific. Thus, while it is self-contained and comprehensible, its applicability to ToolX alone is limited.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Prohibition of Subjective Recommendations", "description": "Agents should refrain from providing subjective recommendations or comments unless supported by user-provided information or available tool functionalities.", "references": ["You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments."], "iteration_added": 1, "comments": "The policy prohibits giving subjective recommendations or comments but is not directly relevant to the target tool 'get_flight_status', which deals with obtaining objective flight status information. While the policy can be validated (since subjective opinions can be assessed against those retrieved from objective sources), it is not actionable using only ToolX\u2019s parameters, chat history, and data access. As a prohibition of action, it's self-contained as it doesn't require more context to understand or implement.\nThe policy is not relevant to the target tool as ToolX deals with querying flight status, which does not involve recommendations or comments. The policy is generic and applies to interpersonal communications rather than tool functionality or invocation criteria. It cannot be validated before using ToolX, as the prohibition is related to user interaction rather than ToolX's operations. The policy is self-contained without ambiguity, but not pertinent to ToolX's task sequence for flight status analysis.\nThe policy is clear in prohibiting subjective recommendations, which is relevant to maintaining objectivity in engagements with users. However, it is not relevant to the specific functionalities of 'get_flight_status' since this tool does not involve providing recommendations or comments. The policy is not specific to ToolX, as it pertains to general conduct rather than tool usage. It could be validated by ensuring user interaction history complies with objectivity. The policy can be deemed actionable because compliance can be enforced based on user data and conversation history, without needing additional context. Given the lack of connection to ToolX, the policy scores low on relevance for this evaluation.\nThis policy is relevant but not specific to ToolX, as it applies to all tools used by the airline agent. It can be validated before using ToolX, as agents can ensure that their responses are based solely on objective data from tools or the user. The policy is actionable, as it requires agents to leverage ToolX's capabilities without personal bias. The initial policy is not fully self-contained due to lack of clarity regarding the emphasis on tool-specific functionalities to guide interactions, so an alternative description has been provided to clarify this aspect.\nThe policy is a general rule applicable to all agents and tools, not specifically to ToolX ('get_flight_status'). It addresses the limitation of providing subjective recommendations or comments, which applies broadly and not particularly to fetching flight status. The policy can be validated by ensuring any communication or recommendation is backed by user-provided information or tool data. Compliance is straightforward\u2014it is about maintaining objectivity unless supported by data. However, the policy does not tailor to specific functionalities or constraints of 'get_flight_status', which deals with technical accuracy rather than subjective advice. This aspect diminishes its relevance to the target tool.\n"}]}
