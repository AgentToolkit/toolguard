However, it is not specific to 'ToolX' alone but to tool calls in general. The policy can be validated since compliance can be verified by checking the sequence of operations. But it is not actionable directly using ToolX\u2019s parameters, chat history, and data access, as it seems to be more of an instruction for tool usage methodology rather than an action driven by tool data. The description is clear and complete, requiring no additional context.\nThe policy pertains to tool usage behavior and ensuring actions are performed sequentially, which is a general policy more than tool specific\u2014applicable to any tool used simultaneously. For ToolX, this is less relevant because the policy doesn't mention validating or processing data specific to updating reservation passengers. While the rule is broad and not unique to ToolX, it is self-contained, as no further context is needed for understanding, and is actionable, emphasizing the sequence of user-agent interactions and tool usage. Assigning a score of 4, mainly because of its broad relevance rather than tool specificity.\nThe policy is straightforward and requires an agent to manage tool calls and user interaction such that no simultaneous actions occur. This can easily be validated by checking the sequence of tool call logs and user interaction timestamps. The rule applies universally to tool use rather than being specific to ToolX, but is directly relevant to how ToolX should be used. It is self-contained, as it provides explicit instructions without needing further context.\nThe 'One Tool Call Rule' is a general policy and applies broadly across all tools, not specifically to ToolX. Thus, it is not tailored for ToolX or the specific functionalities and constraints of ToolX. This rule is more of a procedural guide for interaction management rather than something that can be enforced using ToolX\u2019s specific parameters or data input. However, the policy can be validated as actions performed can be monitored to ensure only one tool call or user response is happening at a time. Despite being applicable generally and not solely to ToolX, the policy is clear and actionable, promoting structured and manageable interactions with users and tool calls. Overall, its lack of specificity to ToolX results in a score of 3.\nThe policy clearly specifies a rule for interaction between tool usage and user communication which applies directly to ToolX. It is not specific to ToolX alone but applies generally to the use of any tool, giving it a broader context. However, it can indeed be validated before tool invocation as the system can be programmed to check that no user response occurs simultaneously with tool calls. This policy does not need additional information to be understood and can be implemented using basic operational checks. Since the policy is clear, enforceable, and directly applicable to the conditions described, I rated it a 5.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Prohibition on Providing External Information", "description": "The agent should strictly utilize information provided by the user or tools available to perform tasks. External knowledge or personal opinions must not be shared, ensuring that all actions and responses are based solely on available resources and factual data.", "references": ["You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments."], "iteration_added": 4, "comments": "This policy clearly outlines that external information or subjective recommendations should not be provided unless they are available through user inputs or tools. However, it is not relevant to ToolX, which focuses on passenger updates and does not involve providing information or recommendations. The policy is actionable in terms of can be validated - you can verify if the agent relies on user inputs or tool outputs, but it cannot be enforced using ToolX parameters. As it stands, the policy is self-contained, offering enough detail to be understood without additional context. However, it does apply to all tools uniformly rather than ToolX specifically.\nThe policy is clearly relevant to ToolX, as it establishes boundaries for what information and actions are permitted when engaging with users. ToolX, focusing on updating reservation details, does not inherently involve providing external information, thus ensuring compliance before use is straightforward. While it applies broadly across all tools, it is actionable, as it focuses on limiting actions to those available within the tool's parameters, data access, and chat history. The policy is self-contained, clearly stating what is not to be done, thereby providing sufficient guidance without needing additional context. The policy could align more specifically with ToolX if examples were included concerning what constitutes external information in the context of passenger reservation updates.\nThe policy is generally clear and applies to all tools, including ToolX, indicating a restriction on providing external information and subjective comments. It can be validated as it necessitates checking the source of information before using ToolX. The policy is actionable as ToolX interactions and user-provided data offer the necessary framework. However, it is insufficiently self-contained, lacking explicit mention that only factual and tool-based information should be used during the agent's activities. A refined description is proposed for comprehensiveness.\nThe policy is a general guideline applicable to all operational aspects rather than specific interactions with ToolX, which is focused on updating reservation passengers. It does not directly pertain to the 'update_reservation_passengers' tool or processes specific to ToolX, making it irrelevant for specific tool invocation validations or actions. The policy is self-contained in that it is clear and requires no additional context to understand. However, it lacks specificity in terms of enforcing or validating compliance prior to using ToolX.\nThis policy is relevant to ToolX as it sets a protocol on how agents should handle and communicate information when using any tool including ToolX. It is not specific to ToolX but applies to all tools, as it is a general guideline for how agents should conduct themselves, ensuring they stick to provided data and resources. While important for ensuring accuracy and reliability in user interactions, it is not directly actionable or verifiable before using a tool because it governs behavior rather than specific tool operations. The policy description is clear and requires no additional context; however, its applicability can be enhanced by defining how compliance can be checked systematically through ToolX's parameters or returns.\n"}]}
