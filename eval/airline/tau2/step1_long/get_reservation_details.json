While the policy is relevant, it is not specific to ToolX only, as it applies broadly to actions involving the booking database. The requirement for explicit user confirmation can be validated prior to using ToolX, ensuring compliance. It is enforceable using the tool's parameters and user interaction data. The policy description is clear and self-contained, needing no further context.\nThe current policy suggests procedures that are relevant to services like booking or modifying reservations but is not directly applicable to the 'Get Reservation Details' tool because it does not involve updating the booking database. Therefore, it's not relevant to ToolX itself. The policy can be validated since it requires user confirmation before actions are taken. However, it is not actionable using ToolX\u2019s parameters, as ToolX does not perform actions that require user confirmation. The policy is self-contained, providing clear instructions without needing additional context. It could be tailored more specifically by referencing tools that directly update reservations or booking information.\nThe policy mentions obtaining explicit user confirmation for several actions, which is a necessary practice for clarity and user consent. However, it is not directly relevant or specific to the target tool (ToolX), which is about retrieving reservation details and does not involve actions that require updates or user confirmation. Thus, applying this policy to ToolX does not make sense in its current form. While the policy can be validated before invoking tools that change booking state, ToolX doesn't require user confirmation. The policy is actionable through a manual process of listing details and asking for confirmation, but these steps are not facilitated by ToolX, which is focused on retrieving data, not altering it.\nThe policy is clear and straightforward in its requirement to obtain user confirmation before performing actions related to flight reservations and modifications. However, it lacks specificity regarding ToolX, which is aimed at retrieving reservation details rather than updating them. Therefore, this policy does not specifically apply to ToolX, but it is an overarching policy applicable to tools that involve updating the booking database. While the policy can be validated manually by collecting user confirmation, it is not actionable through ToolX parameters and functionalities since ToolX\u2019s primary function is retrieving reservation details and not updating them. The policy description is self-contained; no additional context from the policy document is required to understand its purpose or compliance requirements.\nThe policy is clear and actionable, requiring explicit user confirmation before actions affecting the booking database, which can be validated using ToolX\u2019s parameters, chat history, and data access. However, the policy is a general requirement applicable to multiple tool actions rather than specific to ToolX, which is used for retrieving reservation details. ToolX does not modify or update data, so the policy does not directly apply to it. A refined version for ToolX-specific scenarios isn't necessary as its functionality does not involve any updates.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Single Tool Call Policy", "description": "You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.", "references": ["You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time."], "iteration": 0, "comments": "The policy is relevant to the use of ToolX as it restricts usage to single tool calls at a time and ensures the agent does not multitask with tool calls and responding to users simultaneously. This helps maintain the accuracy and integrity of tool interactions, preventing errors from overlapping processes. The policy applies broadly to all tools, hence it's not specifically tailored to ToolX, but ToolX should comply with this operational guideline as well. Compliance can be validated simply by checking the sequence of actions\u2014thus, it is enforceable using only ToolX's parameters and interaction data. The policy is clear and self-contained, requiring no additional context.\nThe policy is more about general interaction rules rather than being specific to ToolX or any tool profiled in the tool descriptions. It does not address specific functionalities or constraints of ToolX, making it less relevant. The requirement to make one tool call at a time without simultaneously responding to users can be validated by checking the interaction flow's structure but does not inherently apply to ToolX's parameters or outputs specifically. To improve relevance to ToolX, the policy could specify any constraints specific to the operation or interaction with ToolX.\nThe 'Single Tool Call Policy' is indeed relevant to the target tool as it dictates how tool interactions should be managed. It is not tool-specific as it applies broadly to all tool interactions and responses, which is a common rule for ensuring clarity and reducing the risk of errors during operations. This policy can be validated because it involves checking the execution sequence of commands to ensure only one tool call happens before any further action or user response. It is actionable as it can be enforced by programming restrictions on simultaneous tool calls and responses within the tool usage parameters. The policy is clear and concise, requiring no additional context.\nThe policy provides clear guidelines on how to handle tool calls: ensuring that only one is made at a time and no simultaneous response to user inquiries. This policy is applicable to all tool usage, not only to ToolX, making it too broad for the specific application to ToolX. Additionally, the policy can be validated before using any tool, as it can be tracked whether another tool call or response is pending or in process. As it is not specific to ToolX, it reduces the relevancy to the target tool. However, following this policy can prevent the overlap of tool calls and responses, providing a clear system operation. The policy is self-contained as the description clearly conveys the rule, does not require extra context, and is enforceable without additional resources. Due to these factors, I'd assign a score of 3, indicating good clarity and applicability in general terms, but lacking specificity to ToolX.\nThe 'Single Tool Call Policy' applies to the workflow of all tools rather than specifically to 'get_reservation_details'. The policy is a general requirement for tool usage and is not relevant to any specific tool, including 'get_reservation_details'. Therefore, it is not tool-specific, and compliance cannot be verified externally from the tool's parameters or capabilities. Additionally, it is not actionable solely based on ToolX's functions as this policy does not provide instruction on any particular tool operation. Although clear and complete in description, assigning a score of 2 to reflect its lack of relevancy and specificity towards ToolX.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Transfer to Human Agent Policy", "description": "Transfer the user to a human agent only if the user requests it explicitly, or if the task cannot be performed using available tools, including ToolX, as per the airline's policies. Validate that the task cannot be resolved before proceeding with the transfer.", "references": ["You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions."], "iteration": 1, "comments": "The policy does apply to ToolX as it is part of the overall scope of actions, but it is not specific to ToolX, as it applies to any request that exceeds tool capabilities, not just ToolX-specific functionalities. It cannot be validated before invoking any tool because the complexity of a request can often only be evaluated during interactions. The policy is not actionable, as it requires judgment outside of ToolX parameters and chat data. The policy requires additional contextual information from the document for full clarity. An improved version was proposed for enhanced self-containment.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX since the transfer to human agent is linked to the usage of tools including reservation details. However, it is not specific to ToolX alone and can be applied across scenarios requiring other tools. Validation can be conducted by checking if the available toolset can address the request, making the policy actionable. The current description lacks details on explicitly requesting a transfer or criteria for evaluating tool capabilities. The proposed alternative description elaborates on when the transfer should occur, supporting clarity and completeness of the policy.\nThe policy is generic and not specific to ToolX which focuses on retrieving reservation details. ToolX offers functionalities around accessing reservation details but does not directly address circumstances for transferring to a human agent. The policy should be adjusted to make clear distinctions about how ToolX specifically resolves issues before opting for a human agent transfer. The current policy cannot be validated before the tool is invoked because it lacks specific conditions related to ToolX usage. Additionally, it is not actionable with the parameters of ToolX alone, as ToolX alone does not offer functionalities around transferring to human agents or resolving all possible user issues. A more detailed policy should clarify how reservation details gathered by ToolX influence the decision to transfer. The alternative description provides a clearer scope regarding the limitations of ToolX and when a transfer to a human agent is justified.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX, as ToolX represents the functionalities that need to be considered before transferring a user to a human agent. However, the policy isn't fully self-contained because it references 'other available resources' without detailing what these resources are. The policy can be validated before invoking ToolX because determining whether an issue is resolvable within scope can be done prior to making calls using ToolX. While the policy is actionable with ToolX parameters, it requires more specificity concerning what constitutes the scope of actions. The alternative description provides clarity on the validation process and scope limitation checking.\nThe policy does not apply specifically to ToolX and is quite broad, encompassing all situations where user requests cannot be handled using available tools. The policy is relevant to the airline agent's overall operations, but not tailored to specific functionalities of ToolX. While it can be validated before invocation, the current description lacks specificity regarding the exact scope of ToolX in determining when to transfer to a human agent. Suggested alternative description narrows down the context for better applicability.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Reservation Detail Access for Modification", "description": "The agent must obtain the user id and reservation id before making any modifications to flight reservations. Details accessed should be checked against current policy rules, ensuring compliance before invoking modification actions.", "references": ["The agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id."], "iteration": 3, "comments": "This policy is relevant to the target tool, which fetches reservation details. It requires the user id and reservation id, making it actionable with the provided inputs. The instructions are clear and straightforward for validation before invoking ToolX, as obtaining these pieces of information is a prerequisite for any modification. However, the policy is not entirely tool-specific because it pertains to any modification action rather than ToolX itself.\nThe policy is applicable to ToolX, which deals with reservation details, and is relevant since obtaining the reservation id is necessary for accessing or modifying the reservation details. The policy can be validated by ensuring that both the user id and reservation id are collected before the modification process initiates. It outlines a clear procedure that must be followed using the tool's parameters. However, the policy is not tool-specific; it applies generally to any tool interacting with reservation details in the modification process. The policy is clear and does not require additional context, making it self-contained.\nThis policy is relevant to the tool as it requires obtaining both user id and reservation id, which is necessary for calling the target tool 'get_reservation_details'. The policy is not specifically tailored to ToolX but can be applicable to any reservation modification process across similar tools. However, the requirement to obtain these identifiers can be validated before invoking the tool, and it can be enforced using available parameters. The policy is self-contained, providing clear instructions without needing additional context.\nThe policy is clear and directly applicable to ToolX, which requires the reservation ID for accessing reservation details. It is relevant specifically to situations involving modification of reservations using ToolX. This policy can be validated before the tool's invocation by ensuring the user ID and reservation ID are provided beforehand. However, the policy itself does not specify actions beyond obtaining these IDs, so it relies on external enforcement mechanisms (like an agent following up with required modifications). Additional instructions or constraints for reservation modification might be needed to make the policy actionable directly through the tool's capabilities without ambiguity regarding implementation steps. Overall, the policy is self-contained as it does not rely on external context beyond what is already specified.\n"}]}
