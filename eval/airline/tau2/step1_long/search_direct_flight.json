The tool can perform searches regardless of flight status. The policy lacks actionable aspects because it does not align with ToolX's capabilities or parameters. It requires external validation to ensure flights can be booked, making it suitable for validation as part of a broader system context. The policy is not self-contained because it assumes flight status validation will occur through other means or systems, and the description lacks context on ToolX\u2019s capabilities.\nThe policy is relevant because it matches the functionality of searching and booking flights with the target tool. However, it lacks specificity to ToolX as it applies broadly to any flight booking scenario. The availability of seats and prices can be validated using ToolX before executing the booking. The policy is not actionable directly through ToolX parameters alone; user inputs and additional validation are required. The description is not self-contained as it lacks clarity regarding the initial selection steps for booking; the alternative description adds necessary context for clarity.\nThe policy is relevant as it relates to booking flights using the search_direct_flight tool. However, it's not specific to the tool, as it applies to all bookings regardless of the tool. It can be validated before invoking the tool by checking flight status, but it lacks tool-specific actionable steps. A refined policy should include preconditions for tool use, such as validating flight status and seat availability explicitly. The score reflects these shortcomings and the need for specificity in tool-based policy enforcement.\nThis policy is relevant to ToolX as it pertains to booking direct flights, which is the tool's function. It can be validated using ToolX's parameters and prior to its invocation by checking flight status through the 'get_flight_status' tool. However, the policy is not tool-specific as it can apply to other flight-search tools as well. The description lacks context on how to check the flight status, which can be clarified using additional details such as validating via the 'get_flight_status' tool. Improved clarity includes specifying the need for validation before using ToolX.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Flight Booking Denied for Specific Statuses", "description": "The agent must ensure using ToolX that all flight bookings are only processed for flights with a status of 'available'. Flights with statuses 'delayed', 'on time', or 'flying' cannot be booked. This requires the use of the 'get_flight_status' tool to cross-check the flight status before booking with ToolX.", "references": ["If the status is 'delayed' or 'on time', the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.", "If the status is 'flying', the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked."], "iteration": 2, "comments": "The policy is relevant to ToolX, as it deals directly with searching direct flights. It can be validated before using ToolX, as you can check the flight status prior to making any call, but the current description isn't clear on how ToolX parameters should be utilized. The original policy stated that flights with certain statuses cannot be booked, which implies a direct action rather than a search feature, causing confusion. The policy description needs improvement to specifically mention that ToolX can search direct flights only when they have an 'available' status. The score reflects the need for improved clarity and connection with actionable steps.\nThe policy describes a rule for booking flights based on their statuses (available, delayed, on time, flying). However, it is not applicable to the target tool 'search_direct_flight', which is focused on searching flights, not booking them. The task of checking eligibility based on flight status is related to booking tools and is not relevant for the search functionality provided by ToolX. Additionally, the policy cannot be validated or enforced directly through ToolX parameters, as it is meant for a booking context involving other tools or data not accessible to ToolX.\nThe policy is relevant to ToolX, as it refines booking operations based on flight status. However, it is not ToolX-specific because it requires the 'get_flight_status' tool for validation. The idea can be validated, but it cannot be actionable solely with ToolX's parameters since ToolX does not have direct access to flight status -- this needs another tool. The original description lacks clarity about tool integration and proper process enforcement. Therefore, an improved version should clearly mention the use of 'get_flight_status' to check flight eligibility before using ToolX to book. Score assigned accounts for these discrepancies and scope for improvement.\nThe policy description is clear regarding the booking constraints based on flight status and makes specific reference to the 'get_flight_status' tool. However, ToolX, which is focused on searching direct flights, doesn't directly match the policy's focus on determining flight status. Tool descriptions indicate 'get_flight_status' should be used instead of ToolX for validating the condition required for the booking. The use of 'get_flight_status' would ensure flights are booked only when available. The policy is actionable, as it provides necessary action and tool support (cross-referencing flight status before booking). However, ToolX itself is not relevant for ensuring booking validity, given its constraints.\n"}]}
