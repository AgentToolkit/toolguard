If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.", "references": ["You should only make one tool call at a time.", "If you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously.", "If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time."], "iteration_added": 2, "comments": "The policy is not specific to ToolX as it applies to general tool usage and interaction workflow rather than specific functionalities or parameters of ToolX. It does not appear to provide instructions or constraints directly relevant or actionable within the context or usage of ToolX, focusing instead on broader procedural guidance. Compliance cannot be validated before ToolX use as it's a general behavior policy about tool calls and user interaction. Although the policy provides clarity as a stand-alone guideline, it lacks definable touchpoints to ToolX, rendering it inapplicable in this specific tool's context.\nThe policy is clear in terms of execution, but it is quite broad and does not specifically relate to the Target Tool 'get_flight_instance'. This policy is applicable across various tools and not limited to ToolX. Additionally, it cannot be validated before using ToolX as the policy governs the agent's action rather than a specific condition that can be pre-verified. While it provides clear instructions, it lacks specificity in terms of scenarios where it could be enforced or validated. Consider focusing policies that can directly be applied or validated using the functionalities or constraints provided by the Target Tool.\nThe policy is generic and applies to any tool that an airline agent might use. Since the target tool is specifically related to fetching flight instances, this policy is not particularly relevant to its operation. The policy can be validated before using any tool, including ToolX (checking if only one tool call is being made at a time and whether an interaction is happening simultaneously). The policy does not dictate specific parameters or actions involving ToolX, which affects its enforceability in the context of ToolX. The description is clear and contains the necessary instructions, making it self-contained. Overall, the policy lacks specificity towards the target ToolX and how it can be actionably used with this policy, thus receiving a lower score.\nThe policy is clear and self-contained, as the description provided succinctly summarizes the rules without needing additional context. However, the relevance to the target ToolX (which seems to deal with flight information retrieval) is minimal, since ToolX does not involve simultaneous user interaction or tool invocation processes that are specifically restricted by this policy. This policy is generally applicable to the agent's behavior across all tool usage rather than being specific to ToolX's functionality. Compliance with the policy can be confirmed before using ToolX, making it possible to validate adherence by tracking tool calls and user interaction sequences. However, since its applicability is not specific to ToolX, it's not actionable in terms of enforcing through ToolX alone.\nThis policy is not specifically relevant to the target tool 'get_flight_instance', as it applies broadly to all tool usage, not just to the target tool. While the policy can be validated (an agent can ensure they are not making a tool call while responding to a user), it is not actionable using only ToolX parameters, chat history, or data. It requires the agent's attention and adherence to process but does not direct a specific action within the parameters of ToolX. The policy assumes correct implementation of usage patterns rather than specific tool-related constraints. The score reflects its lack of specificity to ToolX and overall broad applicability.\n"}, {"policy_name": "Flight Status Booking Policy", "description": "To proceed with booking a flight using ToolX, ensure the flight status is 'available'. This status confirms the flight has not taken off, seats are available, and prices are listed. Bookings cannot be made for flights that are 'delayed', 'on time', or 'flying'. Validate the flight status through ToolX before booking.", "references": ["If the status is 'available', the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.", "If the status is 'delayed' or 'on time', the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.", "If the status is 'flying', the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked."], "iteration_added": 3, "comments": "The policy is not relevant to the target tool 'get_flight_instance', but instead applies to booking a flight, which would be part of 'book_reservation'. It is not tool-specific because this policy applies broadly to any flight booking activity within the system. Compliance with this policy can be validated before booking by checking the flight status using 'get_flight_status'. However, the policy is not actionable in terms of ToolX as the actual booking action involves another tool. The description is clear and self-contained.\nThe policy primarily deals with the booking of flights, and it is relevant to scenarios involving flight booking rather than the 'get_flight_instance' tool, which returns flight details. It does not apply to ToolX directly as ToolX retrieves flight instances rather than booking them. The booking is associated with policies meant for tools like 'book_reservation'. Thus, the policy cannot be validated before invoking 'get_flight_instance'. Additionally, the current description allows some room for better clarity and completeness in terms of flight status for booking, and outlines when flights can be booked under different statuses, so an alternative description has been provided.\nThe policy directly relates to ToolX, as it involves checking the flight status before booking it. While the policy is specific to ToolX, it is not actionable solely through ToolX\u2019s parameters and functions because it involves a decision-making process about availability. To enhance clarity and completeness, it should include instructions on checking status via ToolX before booking. Revised to emphasize validation with ToolX.\n"}]}
