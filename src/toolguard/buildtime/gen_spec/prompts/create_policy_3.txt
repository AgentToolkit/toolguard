Task:
Given a Policy Document, Tools Descriptions, and a Target Tool (ToolX), extract and format all restrictive, tool-gating policy items that should be verified before invoking ToolX.
Your output is a JSON object, as described below.

Instructions:
1. Identify policy items from the Policy Document that are relevant to ToolX.
2. Ensure that extracted policy items:
    * Are **restrictive or conditional** (they must be able to block, limit, or require something for ToolX).
    * Are **specifically applicable to ToolX’s behavior** (not general user entitlements or rules for other tools).
    * Can be validated **before calling ToolX** using ToolX parameters, chat history, or other tools.
    * Are **actionable**, meaning failing the rule would prevent or alter the ToolX invocation.
    * Are **self-contained** and do not rely on unstated context.
3. Tool Scope Filtering
A policy statement applies to ToolX ONLY if violating the policy would make invoking ToolX invalid or incorrect.
If a policy governs:
• another tool,
• a post-tool outcome,
• or general customer benefits,
it MUST be ignored for ToolX.
4. Split policy items into the smallest reasonable parts so that:
    * Each extracted policy contains only one condition.
    * If a policy includes multiple conditions, split it into separate policy items whenever possible.
5. Provide exact references to the Policy Document for each extracted policy.
    * Locate the exact passage(s) in the Policy Document that fully support the policy statement.
    * The corrected reference must be a contiguous, verbatim excerpt from the Policy Document, ensuring it can be precisely highlighted.
    * If no single passage fully supports the policy, replace the incorrect reference with multiple distinct references.
    * Each reference must be a verbatim excerpt that appears exactly as written in the Policy Document.
    * Each supporting passage should be listed separately within the "references" array.
    * Make sure to extract only from the Policy Document and not from other input information like the tool description

### Definitions

A **policy item** is eligible for extraction only if it is:

• **Restrictive** – it limits, forbids, or conditions when ToolX may be called
• **Tool-scoped** – it applies to ToolX’s operation, not to other tools
• **Pre-call enforceable** – it can be evaluated before calling ToolX

**Permissive, descriptive, or benefit-granting rules (e.g., “gold members may…”) MUST NOT be extracted unless they also impose a restriction or condition.**

Input Format:
Policy Document – A text containing policy items, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A dictionary tool names and descriptions. The descriptions explaining the tool functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX) – The specific tool for which relevant policy items need to be identified.

Output Format:
Your output format should be a valid JSON object, according to this example:
```
{
  "policy_items": [
    {
      "name": "<Policy 1 Name>",
      "description": "<Policy 1 Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage 1 from Policy Document>",
        "<Exact Passage 2 from Policy Document>",
         ...
      ]
    },
    ...
    {
      "name": "<Policy n Name>",
      "description": "<Policy n Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage n from Policy Document>"
         ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

If no relevant policy items exist, just return a JSON object with an empty list of items:
```
{
  "policy_items": []
}
```
