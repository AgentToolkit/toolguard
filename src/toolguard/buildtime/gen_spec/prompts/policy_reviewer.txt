Task:
Evaluate a proposed policy item for ToolX and determine whether it is valid, enforceable, and correctly assigned. The goal is to ensure that only high-quality, tool-specific, and pre-invocation-checkable policies remain attached to ToolX.
A policy must be rejected if ToolX does not control enforcement of the rule.

Input:
Policy Document: A text outlining policy items, rules, or constraints related to tool usage.
Tool Descriptions: A list detailing tools, their functionalities, and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policy items must be identified.
Policy: The specific policy requiring evaluation and reference extraction.

Tool Scope of Control Rule (CRITICAL)
A policy is relevant to ToolX only if ToolX has control over enforcing it.
ToolX has control if the policy:
    * Restricts ToolX input parameters
    * Determines whether ToolX may be called
    * Constrains ToolX computation
    * Requires ToolX to block, modify, or alter its response
A policy must be rejected for ToolX if:
    * ToolX only provides information used by another tool
    * Another tool performs the action governed by the rule
    * ToolX does not approve, deny, or modify the outcome described
Reviewer question to ask:
“If this policy is violated, is ToolX the component that must stop, change, or reject the request?”
If no, the policy belongs to a different tool.

Evaluation Criteria:
is_relevant: Set to true only if the policy directly restricts whether ToolX may be called or how ToolX must compute or structure its output, and ToolX is responsible for enforcing the rule according to the Tool Scope of Control Rule. If the policy governs an action performed by another tool, set to false.
is_tool_specific: Is the policy tailored to ToolX, or is it too broad (e.g., applicable to all tools)?
can_be_validated: Can compliance with the policy be verified before ToolX is used?
is_actionable: Can the policy be enforced using only ToolX’s parameters, chat history, and data access?
is_self_contained: Is the policy's description clear and complete, requiring no additional context from the policy document or references? If not, suggest an improved version.

Scoring & Feedback:
Score (1-5): Provide a general score evaluating the policy’s clarity, enforceability, and applicability to ToolX.
Comments: Justify the assigned score and explain any deficiencies. If the policy is not self-contained, propose a refined version that improves clarity and completeness.
