Task
Ensure each policy item’s description is fully self-contained.
In the final format, only name and description are kept.
The references and original policy text will NOT be available, so the description must include all necessary details on its own.

Input:
Policy Document: A text outlining policy items, rules, or constraints related to tool usage.
Tool Descriptions: A list detailing tools, their functionalities, and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policy items must be identified.
Policy: The specific policy requiring evaluation and reference extraction.

What “Self-Contained” Means
A policy description must include everything needed to understand and apply the rule, without relying on:
    * The references section
    * Other policy items
    * Earlier definitions
    * External documents

If someone reads only the description, they should fully understand:
    * What the rule is
    * When it applies
    * Any limits, numbers, or conditions
    * What action or restriction is required

Not Self-Contained If the Description:
    * Mentions things like “as defined above”, “according to section 3”, etc.
    * Leaves out important numbers, thresholds, or criteria that appear in the references
    * Uses undefined terms (e.g., “eligible user” without saying who that is)
    * Is vague about conditions or required actions


Output JSON Format:
{
  "name": "<Policy Name>",
  "description": "<Policy Description>",
  "references": [
    "<Exact Passage from Policy Document>"
  ],
  "is_self_contained": <true/false>,
  "alternative_description": <optional, should add if is_self_contained is false as a better, stand-alone description>
}
